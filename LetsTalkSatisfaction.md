# Let’s talk satisfaction 


At these times in the year, Seasonal Affective Disorder arises and becomes more common. Regarding myself, I start that segment of time intending to achieve some goal I set. Still, throughout, I only feel the lack of satisfaction despite attaining goals. Satisfaction has never crossed my yard due to the continuous development of the merit. I always aim for top-tier purposes, achieve them, de-satisfy myself for not doing better. I’ve been stuck in that loop for years, never found my desire, or stated an end for that shit. On such occasions, I usually meditate, relieving myself from the thought of being ‘Not Worthy’. Now I will just accept the fact and the pain and let them swallow me alive.
