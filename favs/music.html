        <h2>Introduction</h2> <p>Music nourishes souls. While all people prefer a specific type and go with it, I usually listen to various genres according to my mood. I will try to make my Discography as various as possible to cover my different eras. I use the semi-open headphones Samson SR850 as my main, I am willing to buy Beyerdynamic DT 1990 pro when I inherit money or date a rich GF. Listen peacefully and have fun.</p> <br/> 
        <h2>Discography</h2> <p>When I firstly constructed a list, I felt I won't be representing my true taste. Thus, I had two options: either remove this page at all, or choose one song/album that represents me. As result, I happily went with the second option and I knew what to choose.</p> <br/> <img src=art/ram-min.jpg alt=random access memories> <h3>Daft Punk - Random Access Memories</h3> <p>This album is what future will be like. In 3490, when humans have outgrown existence, people will still listen to this album and find ecstasy. RAM starts with &quot;Giving life back to music&quot;, go through all the living sensations, ends with a new view for the &quot;horizon&quot;.</p> <p><br/><br/>
