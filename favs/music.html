        <h2>Introduction</h2> <p>Music nourishes souls. While all people prefer a specific type and go with it, I usually listen to various genres according to my mood. I will try to make my Discography as various as possible to cover my different eras. I use the semi-open headphones Samson SR850 as my main, I am willing to buy Beyerdynamic DT 1990 pro when I inherit money or date a rich GF. Listen peacefully and have fun.</p> <br/> 
        <h2>Discography</h2> <p>I will choose the five albums, and five singles that I remembered instantly while writing this. They may not be my best ever, but they are the ones that did hit my mind.</p> <br/> <img src=art/ram-min.jpg alt=random access memories> <h3>Daft Punk - Random Access Memories</h3> <p>This album is what future will be like. In 3490, when humans have outgrown existence, people will still listen to this album and find ecstasy. RAM starts with &quot;Giving life back to music&quot;, go through all the living sensations, ends with a new view for the &quot;horizon&quot;.</p> <p><br/><br/></p> <img src=art/goodtimes-min.jpg alt=good times> <h3>Willie Nelson - Good Times</h3> <p>Good Times is maybe the weirdest on this list. I have never thought I will like Country Music; they were never good. However, the first time I heard &quot;Buddy&quot; in the TV Show &quot;Parks and Recreation&quot;, I felt something weird; I instantly stopped the episode and looked up the song to hear. I was too amazed to the level of downloading the FLAC version for the album and played it. The album was literally 30 minutes that make people in heaven feel jealous of Earthers.</p> <p><br/><br/></p>
        <img src=art/tpab.jpg alt=tpab> <h3>Kendrick Lamar - To Pimp A Butterfly</h3> <p>While Eminem is my favourite Hip-Hop artist, my favourite hip-hop <b>story</b> album of all time is Kendricks. I hear it occasionally and remember all of my achievements, victories, and defeats. It is the album from hell that makes heavens people jealous.</p> 
        
        <p><br/><br/></p> <img src=art/demondays-min.jpg alt=demon-days> <h3>Gorillaz - Demon Days</h3> <p>I can classify this album as &quot;weird&quot; but it turns on a weird neuron that gives me pleasure. I would label this album as &quot;the moment between tipsiness and being drunk&quot;, A 50-minute moment that will send you to the nearest nebula.</p> <p><br/><br/></p> <img src=art/bitchesbrew-min.jpg alt=bitches brew> <h3>Miles Davis - Bitches Brew</h3> <p>The end shall be with the end of everything. &quot;Bitches Brew&quot; is the only album from this list that I never recommended to a friend or a partner. Every time I hear this album, I feel jealousy. I feel I do not want anyone to share it with me. This album is not just enjoyable, but I feel intimacy with it. I can hear it over and over and never get bored. If this album was a person, I would fall instantly in love with.</p> <p><br/><br/></p> <h2>Kendrick Lamar - Sing about me,  I'm dying of thirst</h2>
        <p><br/><br/></p> <img src=art/madcity-min.jpeg alt=madcity> <h3>Kendrick Lamar - Good Kid, M.A.A.D. City</h3> 
        <p>Kendrick made it twice to this list. But I can not mention the album with 5 of my best songs of all time.
            Mad city takes you to a journey that you'll never forget. How can this list no contain the album that has "Sing about me, I'm dying of thirst", "Black Boy Fly", "Bitch Don't Kill my Vibe", "Backseat Freestyle", "The art of peer pressure", "Real", "Swimming Pools" ?!
        </p>
        <p><br/><br/></p>
        <h2>Eminem - When I'm Gone</h2>
        <p>While this is not the &quot;best&quot; song by Eminem, it gives me a weird type of encouragement. When I was sick in bed for two weeks, I can remember hearing this song multiple times. This is the best drug to have when you face setbacks.</p>
        <p><br/><br/></p>
        <h2>Pink Floyd - Shine On You Crazy Diamond</h2>
        <p>I can never express how this song feels. The only thing I can say is that it is a trip you will never feel bad you have taken, but you will repeat it once, twice, and infinitely and never get bored.</p>
        <p><br/><br/></p>
        <h2>Queen - Bohemian Rhapsody &amp; Killer Queen</h2>
        <p>This is the only pair here. I almost always listen to both followed, not only because they followed in my queue but also because they make you feel you took both the red pill and the blue pill.</p>
        <p><br/><br/></p>
        <h2>Portishead - Roads</h2>
        <p>The title is very suitable for the song itself. The road you take when you put the song on can be measured in thousands of kilometers that you can walk through and never get tired of. However, it always ends with the moment that you question your existence, your goals, your philosophies, your partners, your friends.</p>
        <br/><br/>
        <h2>Evanescence - My Immortal</h2>
        <p>&quot;There is just too much that time can not erase&quot;. Ben Moody's amazing music, mixed with Amy Lee's god-like voice made the best feat. This song helped me through some of my depression moments by assisting me in "letting it out".</p>
