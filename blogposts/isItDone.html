<h1>Is It Done?</h1> <p>It is commonly assumed that a portion of people wants to &quot;suicide&quot; due to their severe depression/ anxiety. However, I do not think this case applies to me. When I get suicidal thoughts, they were more likely due to my &quot;boredom&quot;. While this is ironic, I noticed it is profoundly true in my case. I usually do new things every now and then. Still, whenever I have nothing to do for a couple of days, I get a feeling of emptiness that degrades my brain. I get the feeling of uselessness and incompetency. I really can not stand the idea of doing nothing at all. I spend time usually to discover and explore new things, but sometimes I just can not find a thing to do, or you can say &quot;I got bored of it&quot;. This does not only apply to a specific aspect; it is pretty generalized in my life. I get bored of emotions, people, specialty, and entertainment. Just consider it a global rule; I get bored of everything and everyone. My life has been a loop between my &quot;emptiness&quot; phase and other phases filled with new things I discover and get swamped in for a while. Then, I get back to my emptiness, and if nothing came to fill it quick, it gets upgraded from &quot;boredom&quot; to the deadly, lethal, motiveless suicidal thoughts <em>(Or technically, masturbation first)</em>.</p> <p>Now, during one of my void phases, I decided to raise a question: &quot;Will it ever be done?&quot;. I suffered from continuous shitty feelings due to my obnoxious thoughts, so it is foreseeable that I will try to fix it. What can I consider as a solution? Maybe &quot;discover new things&quot;, fuck you that will be &quot;done&quot; sometime and I will return to my void. The issue is that the magnitude of my rebuttal phase is measured by the magnitude of its previous state. Thus, if I reached goals, unlocked abilities, updated things, I will get wrecked by a punch with the same power of my achievements. <em>&quot;What about ... achieve nothing, and calm?</em> This is unfortunately unfeasible to me, I can not do nothing, I talked about it on multiple occasions, I even tried it for a couple of years, but I only get in a more <strong>bulk</strong> fist fight.</p> <center><img style="width:100%" src="./isItEnd-DepressionScale.gif"></center> However, I am glad to announce that I finally found the solution! The solution is to simply kill myself! _[hears celebration from the crowd]_ <p>But I will not simply go and kill myself right now, there is still a lot of shit to do before taking such a prominent and impactful <em>well, not really,</em> decision. Thus, I decided to go on the extra mile and see what the world has to offer, maybe new music innovation come to light <em>[Crying in Daft Punk]</em>, perhabs I decide to get a new job, go for a PhD, have some casual sex <em>or formal, I'm into having sex with suits</em>. The important regarding this is that I have taken the decision to end my life peacefully, but I have not stated the date and location yet. I am happy that I finally asserted that decision. Now I can have fun doing everything in life without restrictions knowing that I decided to die. I cleared the burden of continuous suicidal thoughts by deciding to suicide, and when I feel I am done with all of life's offers, I will cheerfully and blissfully end my life.</p> <p>Now, maybe I had no control over how my timeline started, but I will be the one who chooses how and it will end.</p> <p>I will add any updates to this article, so keep checking it frequently until you find the title's answer.</p>
