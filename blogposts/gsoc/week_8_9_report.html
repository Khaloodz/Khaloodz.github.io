<h1>Week 8 & 9 Report</h1>
<p>Hello everyone, one more update as we approach the final weeks of the project.</p>
<p>TL;DR: Finished certificates caching, revisited proposal</p>
<h2>Fixing Certificates Caching</h2>
<p>I have finally figured out how to finalize the caching of certificates without needing to do a lot of code changes. You can see one failed attempt <a href="https://gerrit.libreoffice.org/c/core/+/153301">here</a> where I did around 350 changes across 20 files to still not crack the issue.
However, this marked my first actual usage of those design patterns I have learned once a few months ago and never used them in a project.
I have successfully implemented caching with a simple way smaller change <a href="https://gerrit.libreoffice.org/c/core/+/155373">here</a> with a singleton (I know it is like the last resort, but it was suitable for this exact situation).
Even though no issues have been faced during testing now, I will be submitting a patch with some changes to assure thread-safety for that singleton.</p>
<h1>Progress</h1>
<p>Now, let's revisit our initial goals for the project:</p>
<ul>
<li>[x] Develop a mechanism to remember selected recipients for future saves</li>
<li>[x] Improve the recipient selection UI to make it more intuitive and user-friendly (*)</li>
<li>[x] Allow intelligently searching for keys in large keyrings</li>
<li>[x] Improve UI latency for navigating large keyrings</li>
<li>[x] Implement a filtering feature to narrow down search results</li>
<li>[ ] Add asynchronous querying for improved performance (**)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>(*) Pending Improvements for the TreeView which was picked up throughout the process</em></p>
<p><em>(**) Caching was decided to be an enough-solution to avoid the hurdle of always running a feature that is used by a small portion of users</em></p>
<p>We can see that most of the initial goals have been successfully achieved pending some tiny parts. Next weeks we will just chill and revisit all parts for documentation/ improvements. Also, since multiple bugs are there on bugzilla related to certificate management, I will be working on them in the upcoming weeks and even after GSoC I will try to keep up with any bugs related to this area since I have dived well enough into it.</p>
<h2>A Special Acknowledgment</h2>
<p>Before concluding, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Thorsten Behrens, Heiko Tietze, and Hossein Nourikhah. Their guidance and enthusiasm have propelled my progress. LibreOffice thrives on collaboration and camaraderie, and I am grateful to be part of such an amazing community.</p>
<p>That's it, see you in the upcoming weeks! Feel free to email me with any questions, concerns, or even chatting! &lt;3</p>
