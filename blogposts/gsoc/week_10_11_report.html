<h1>Week 10 11 Report</h1>
<p>Hello everyone, one more update and we are approaching the final week. It has been an incredible journey, and I am grateful for each and every part of it.</p>
<p>TL;DR: Finished the set requirements in the proposal, next on focusing on the documentation and solving related bugs on Bugzilla</p>
<h2>Proposal's Requirements</h2>
<p>Let's visit the points we have set initially for the project.</p>
<ul>
<li>[x] Develop a mechanism to remember selected recipients for future saves</li>
<li>[x] Improve the recipient selection UI to make it more intuitive and user-friendly</li>
<li>[x] Allow intelligently searching for keys in large keyrings</li>
<li>[x] Improve UI latency for navigating large keyrings</li>
<li>[x] Implement a filtering feature to narrow down search results</li>
</ul>
<p>We can see that we have successfully achieved the project's initial goals. It has been a magnificent journey where I learned a lot and worked with one of the best codebases I have encountered with some of the finest developers in the community. I am glad for the progress but sad that the journey has almost ended. However, needless to say, I will keep working with LibreOffice in the future, mainly tackling issues related to Digital Signatures (feel free to CC me on any of those which arise).
Next week, I will be improving the documentation part of the xmlsecurity module to include a subset of the information I learned throughout the journey so next developers will suffer less. I will also be iterating over issues related to certificate management and digital signatures in general.
I will also file some improvement tickets on BZ for things that could be done to improve the experience.</p>
<h2>A Special Acknowledgment</h2>
<p>Before almost concluding the journey, I would love to express my sincere gratitude and appreciation to Thorsten Behrens, Heiko Tietze, and Hossein Nourikhah. Their guidance and enthusiasm have been the fuel that pushed the progress. I would also love to thank all of LibreOffice developers for their continuous work on the project.</p>
<p>See you in the next and final week! Feel free to email me with any questions, concerns, or only chatting! &lt;3</p>
