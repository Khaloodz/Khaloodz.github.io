<h1>Do you know the feeling?</h1>
<p style="text-align:center;">l don't think my end want the best for me <br>
That's why the question me, fake G checking me <br>
Fuck the road but if anybody's testin' me <br>
It's one step away like a 5-a-side penalty <br>
Ain't is funny how this cash that I'm gettin' <br>
Came from fuckin' PA's like I'm sleepin' with a secretary <br>
We're all nothin' to someone, and that you can't forget <br>
You thnik I'm playin' any games? <br>
Why do you think I talk about cars, women and chains <br>
On half of the songs I do, materialistic aims <br>
Make me feel a way when I want it <br>
When I got it, it don't ever feel the nothing <br>
We got different types of problems <br>
If you think it's dead you're mistaken <br>
I'm hot headed and dangerous <br>
And still livin' in this matrix <br>
All I wanna do is make my loved ones proud <br>
In this year alone we made three hundred thousand <br>
We got different types of life problems <br>
What do you know about livin' in a shadow <br>
Here every single thing that you can do is still tainted <br>
Twelve or thirteen when l treid into an adult <br>
All them kids my age were goin' pathetic <br>
I know so many man who got a will on their head <br>
That I would kill to come home but their chances are narrow <br>
In this world that we live in nobody listens <br>
We do have thoughts but nobody's thinkin' <br>
And I get it 'cause none of us are tyna kill the victim <br>
Any disrespect then retaliation, instant <br>
I know myself a lot of man have been dodgin' karma <br>
You know the difference between life and death <br>
Is one bad decision, three or four inches <br>
So many man my age have got P.T.s.d <br>
And I don't think that today it's hit them <br>
If you envision, the way that we're probably liviin' <br>
The things that we had seen, situations that we'd been in <br>
You would understand why I do not wanna talk about my life <br>
I raelly wannna help <br>
But it's out of my controi and jurisdiction <br>
But a lot of road yutes have got a sickness, mentally <br>
Like, look <br>
In a weird way summer it's the coldest season <br>
One day you're chillin' closer in secondary <br>
Next day your right hand's still a words memory <br>
So when I do say that I'm alone, do you know the feelin'? <br>
When I say the game's over, do you know the meanin'? <br>
So when I say that I'm alone, do you know the feelin'? <br>
When I say the game's over, do you know the meanin'? <br>
So when I say that I'm alone, do you know the feelin'? <br>
When I say the game's over, do you know the meanin'? <br>
I mean that I don't have nothnig for this <br>
I got people to inside and I don't write to them <br>
It's like me don't feel pain no more <br>
It's like I don't feel fake shit no more <br>
I can't do hold journeys on the train no more <br>
Can't shed no tear writin' on a page no more <br>
I don't wanna value games no more <br>
I don't want my friends on a case no more <br>
I'm only too big for this nonsense, myself, I don't neeed problems <br>
Myself, I don't need a deal or holding an option <br>
I got a lot of love for everyone that tryna checks for me <br>
And a lot of love for certain girls sexually <br>
Textin' me, sayin' that she slept on me <br>
And definitely wishes that she slept with me <br>
Look <br>
I got a lot of things I'm dealin' with mentally <br>
I feel down a lot and I ain't not got the energyy <br>
I need all of your help to get the best from me <br>
There's way too much to do, I ain't gettin' sleep <br>
The last time I got a rest they arrested me <br>
Tell me a fuck for a video I didn't make myself from scratch <br>
Every lyric, every melody <br>
Every fuckin' beat <br>
Every little detail in the art work and video <br>
Everything is myself me <br>
I don't want short-term success or a banger <br>
Man are signin' to a sentence, gettin' lost in the words <br>
And it's fine if you sign, I guess, it's each to their own <br>
But these clones need to know that I'm different from the world, I am <br>
Don't compare me to them, they couldn't beat me at my worst <br>
Look <br>
People don't get that I'm killing serious <br>
I don't wanna play games no more <br>
I give it five or ten minutes 'til your main ting talks <br>
No more, no, myself don't wanna play no more <br>
No talks if it isn't money made no more <br>
No more, no, I don't wanna play no more <br>
I don't wanna play no games no more <br>
No more, mummy is ain't gotta hurt no more <br>
You ain't gotta cry in that shirt no more <br>
Mummy you ain't gotta wake up for work in the freezin' cold <br>
In the middle of the night for a check no more <br>
Mummy you ain't gotta cry no more <br>
You ain't gotta stress in the night no more <br>
Farewell, I ain't gotta say no more <br>
We ain't playin' games no more</p>
