<h1>When You're Strange</h1> <p>Random people form friendships for only one of two reasons: a common similitude or the resemblance of an enemy. The similitude can range from a basic inclination to severe enthusiasm. On the contrary, the resemblance can be range from a variety of inclinations to noticeable disputations. Every resemblance can be considered a negation of a similitude; it is easier to divide them into two quantities that define the relationship between any two persons. Consequently, the similitude and the resemblance can't logically collide. In other words, having a more significant &quot;enemy&quot; eliminates the possibility of similitude as it leads to a sensible contradiction. So, what would occur if both the &quot;enemy&quot; and the &quot;similitude&quot; were extraordinarily voluminous? <span style="font-size:4px">Welcome to the dilemma of my social life.</span></p> <pre><code>People are strange when you're a stranger Faces look ugly when you're alone Women seem wicked when you're unwanted Streets are uneven when you're down </code></pre> <p>Obviously, my identity's unique trait is its arbitrariness and flexibility. While this makes me an extraordinarily charming and exciting person to be with, it makes me form both strong similitude and resemblance with most people. If you have personally contacted me, you will find a weird connection between us. It will be noticed how much similitude we have, which will spark our kin(k)ship. Even though our connection is &quot;real,&quot; the issue is that I have it with almost all people (hence including your enemy). How can we form a relationship if we have both similitude and resemblance?</p> <pre><code>When you're strange Faces come out of the rain When you're strange No one remembers your name </code></pre> <p>The answer is simple: we cannot. We may form an instantaneous friendship that lasts days, weeks or even years. But we will never create that &quot;bond that can not broken,&quot; which is something only people with a very narrow scope and much wider mental limitations can have. While I may be your closest buddy smoking weed, you will unconsciously further, and our relationship will fade. I share your taste of music and your interest in hoarding lossless hi-res songs, but you can not stand how much I smoke and seek pleasure at the expense of others. I will procrastinate and waste time with you, but I will still have a consistently high performance. You will find me sharing your niche interests, but I will share the stuff you probably hate the most. I do not contradict myself. A person's unique similitude is not necessarily related to his resemblance. Unfortunately, you are not usually consciously thinking about it, but the estrangement inevitably happens. Does this mean I was sentenced to being either desolated or lacking a congenial company?</p> <pre><code>When you're strange Faces come out of the rain When you're strange No one remembers your name </code></pre> <p>Well, it depends on how you are going to define the lonesome. I will easily create lifelong connections with my overflowed charisma. I will hop into any new environment and instantaneously form <em>friendships</em> and people will glorify my existence. The following step is always linked with time. Give it time, and even though the glory will hold its consistency, the presence of anti resemblance will escalate. Regardless of the magnitude of the initial eminence, your unconscious conscious will push you away.</p> <p>Ummm... Yeah I guess I am eternally doomed.</p> <pre><code>When you're strange When you're strange When you're strange </code></pre>
