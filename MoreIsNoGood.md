# More is no Good


An intuitive mind gives you many glorious opportunities throughout your life, but what do you pay in contrast? Having many options. This payment, if got SWOTted a lot, will count it as an opportunity but is it? I’ve always had a lot of that shit in my life, I had multiple options, and sometimes they’re all right, but freedom of choice isn’t still fair.

Even though I fucking hate it, Apple has her philosophy concerned on that topic. Why give clients many new phones and models every year while we can only provide them with one? Why give them a specific description of each piece of hardware while we can just tell them that it takes cool pics in mirrors? They just play it simple. They won’t ask you for the dish you wanna eat, but they’ll cook your favorite recipe flawlessly. In contrast, some android companies like Samsung and shit just throw up like thousand phones each year with no stable optimization for all, so the average person will just get frustrated and go with fewer options even if he’s got restricted. Nevertheless, I’m a man who respects FOSS. I love to have my own customization for everything I’m using and be aware of each and every shit I’m using. This philosophy isn’t restricted to tech stuff. It’s just about everything in my life. I always like to have every option in my hand; more options mean more opportunities than more chances to be happy, right? No.

I like mathematics? Maybe CS? Maybe Physics? What about starting a porn career? Maybe go for engineering? Wait, life is meaningless. What about just dicking around to death? But wait, I’ve to contribute to our random chaos of this carbon randomly gathered on a rock in space to maybe make it less chaotic? Or I can just ignore everything and die? Follow my animal desires, and just fuck and eat to death? Get my body ribbed to women? Maybe try fucking men? Wait, why fuck at all? Can I just stop caring about sex and try to build a tolerance to human desires? Help humanity beat the chaos? Or be a part of the confusion myself? Why the fuck would anyone ever buy a pineapple pizza? What should I do after eating my shitty pizza? Do I drink coke or smoke coke? Why shou…… <em>[my mom interrupts]</em>

Do not give me choices; I don’t want to be confused; I like it simple, treat please me as 5 [crying noises].
