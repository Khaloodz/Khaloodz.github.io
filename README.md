# Tokhy's Hub
## Introduction
Hello boyz, that is a personal blog that I decided to make. I was too proud to use any frameworks or blog-managing services, so I decided to use shell scripts manipulating HTML and CSS. Visit [Blog Announcement](https://tokiesan.github.io/blogposts/AnnouncingTheBlog.html) for more info.

## Extra
Since reusability wasn't a goal, it will be hard to fast-clone the thing. However, feel free to use any shit available here for your own sake, it's under GPL-2.
